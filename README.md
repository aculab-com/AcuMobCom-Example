# AcuMobCom component Example (Demo)

This Example demonstrates use of the Aculab package AcuMobCom from [react-native-aculab-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-aculab-client). It allows you to make calls to Aculab cloud services from iOS and Android platforms and to send dtmf. It Also supports peer-to-peer video/audio calls.

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

### 2. Install node_modules

In the root folder run

``` node
npm install
```

### 3. Install pods for ios

``` node
npx pod-install
```

OR install pods directly from ios folder using

``` node
pod install
```

### 4. Manually add DTMF method for android

Open node_modules/react-native-webrtc/android/src/main/java/com/oney/WebRTCModule/WebRTCModule.java and into the class WebRTCModule add the method bellow.

**If you skip this step, Android platform will throw an error when the method sendDtmf is called.**

``` java
@ReactMethod
public void peerConnectionSendDTMF(String tone, int duration, int interToneGap, int objectID) {
    PeerConnection pc = getPeerConnection(objectID);
    RtpSender sender = pc.getSenders().get(0);

    if (sender != null) {
        DtmfSender dtmfSender = sender.dtmf();
        dtmfSender.insertDtmf(tone, duration, interToneGap); // Timers are in ms
    }
}
```

### 5. Edit parameters given to AcuMob in devConstants.dev.ts file to fit your own cloud account

You can change default registration credentials in the devConstants.dev.ts.
This step is not required but it makes testing easier, however you can always edit these props in the registration screen via UI in the Example application.

[AcuMobCom props](https://github.com/aculab-com/AcuMobCom-Example/blob/main/devConstants.dev.ts)

```typescript
const webRTCAccessKey: string = '';
const apiAccessKey: string = '';
const cloudRegionId: string = '';
const cloudUsername: string = '';
const logLevel: string = '';
const registerClientId: string = '';
}
```

Now you're good to go.
